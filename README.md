# Fetch Coding Challenge #

Welcome to Alan's code for the Fetch coding exercise! [The web service](https://alanrmendez.github.io/fetch-coding-challenge/) is constructed as a minimalistic, streamlined, and intuitive service that performs the requested tasks: 
1. Adds transactions for a specific payer and date, 
2. Spends points as permitted and returns a list for each call, and 
3. Returns all payer point balances. 

While the front-end presentations could admittedly be improved for a more aesthetically pleasing user experience, I wanted to provide you with my work as soon as possible so that you can see the back-end functionality. If you have time, I would love your feedback on its performance and any areas you find could benefit from greater efficiency! Thank you very much for your consideration, and I look forward to hearing from you.
